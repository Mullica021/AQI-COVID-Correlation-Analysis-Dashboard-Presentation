**Introduction**

The COVID 19 pandemic, which started in 2019, has changed the way the world works. Due to global deaths, nations around the world have taken precautions that have affected their respective economies. Because of this, it is important to study what has already transpired in order to brace for what is about to come. From the past couple of years that the pandemic has taken place, there have been heaps of real data that can be studied. This dataset provides these data. Although it only includes data regarding the United States, it can give us a clearer picture of what we are actually dealing with, so we can predict and plan accordingly for the future.
This dataset includes numerous variables that may explain the pandemic's dynamics. Most importantly, it also includes the number of daily confirmed cases and deaths of all 50 states and their respective counties across 9 months in 2021. From this, we can investigate which variables contribute to cases and deaths the most, and properly predict these all-important variables as well. By doing so, we can slow down the deaths globally since we will find out the contributing factors to both cases and deaths.
